# GoogleMapAPI-React
### This repo consists two different approaches to this project.
1. `google-map-react` consists code that is created with `google-map-react` library. [Click here](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react/blob/HEAD/API.md) to see more about the library.
2. `react-google-maps` branch consists code that is created with `google-map-react` library.[Click here](https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/) to see more about the library.
